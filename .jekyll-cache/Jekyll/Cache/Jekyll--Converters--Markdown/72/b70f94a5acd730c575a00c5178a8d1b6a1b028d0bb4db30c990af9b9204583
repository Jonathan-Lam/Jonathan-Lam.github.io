I"Ñ<p>Iâ€™ve spent some time learning/working on this website using Jekyll and Bootstrap 4. Through a mixture of documentation, trial and error, and perseverance, I at least have a basic layout of what details I want to display on this site. However, I did get caught up on one details; how to highlight the navbar link depending on the current page. I figured I would show how I did this below to impart this knowledge to fellow front end web developer learners.</p>
