Using Jekyll and Bootstrap, the goal is to design a sleek and modern website to have a place to showcase projects and achievements with blogging capabilities. This project is a good opportunity to explore front end technology and design. Jekyll is a static website generator that can be hosted on Github Pages, while Bootstrap is a widely used front end framework for web development.

Besides Jekyll and Bootstrap, this project has opened up other avenues to explore, such as working with Ruby and RubyGems, jQuery and more complex JavaScript functionality, and organizing what I have explored into articles to share with others. I hope that by posting occasional articles, I can record my progress and organize mythoughts.
